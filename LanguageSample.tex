\chapter{Sample of \LanguageName}

Here we provide some samples of both how \LanguageName\ sounds and looks.

\section{Sample Names}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.7\textwidth}|}\hline
If you are not doing a naming language, you may want to leave out the names section.
The roots that you created in order to make the names will be in the dictionary and marked (name).
\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Many of these names are based on words in \LanguageName\ as used anciently.
The exact same base word may have adjusted in a different way over time simply because of it serving as a name.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\noindent
\textbf{Am} loyal one (often mis-etymologized as small loyalty, but the earliest version of this name is An)\\
\textbf{Bo} strong\\
\textbf{Do} good\\
\textbf{Fo} soldier (spear person)\\
\textbf{Go} soldier (sword person)
\end{multicols}

\section{Sample Translations}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.7\textwidth}|}\hline
If you are not providing vector drawings nor a font, then the third column will be missing since you can't provide a rendering.
These sentences have been pulled from the ``Graded Sentences for Analysis.''\\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The first column is the English sentence being translated.
The second column is the translation romanized to allows you to approximate how it sounds.
The third column is a rendering of the translation in it's custom orthography.
