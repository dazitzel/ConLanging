LCT is my XeLaTeX conversion of a pages template provided by David Petersen and Jessie Simms from LangTime Studio.
I updated how the consonants and vowels are displayed, made changes to the word-type category in the dictionary explanation, and (being TeX) added a couple of macros.
The rest are their words.

Hopefully I might get around to actually using it too!
