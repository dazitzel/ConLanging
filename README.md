Language Template began as my XeLaTeX conversion of a pages template provided by David Petersen and Jessie Simms from LangTime Studio.
I've turned it into a full blown list of reminders of what to include in a language description along with changes to the word-type category in the dictionary explanation, and (being TeX) using macros.

Hopefully I might get around to actually using it too!

A re-working of the METAFONT Tutorial with the hope that I will eventually include how to get a ttf file out of it.
