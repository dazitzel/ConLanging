			<p>This book began as a rewrite of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The METAFONT Tutorial</i> by Christophe Grandsire. There is much of his work that I have copied, in technical details if not in style. Thanks also goes to <a href="https://standardebooks.org/">standard ebooks</a> which served as a basis for how I organized my ebook. The greatest thanks must go to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The METAFONT Book</i> by Donald Ervin Knuth, and perusing that will help immensely. We must also thank him as the creator of METAFONT.</p>
